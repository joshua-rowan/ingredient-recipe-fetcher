# Ingredient-Recipe-Maker

## Description

The Ingredient Recipe Maker will offer up a recipe to the user who has all the ingredients, but doesn't know what to cook.
This is for anyone who has ever looked at their pantry and or their refrigerator, seen that it's full of food, but still said to themselves, "I have nothing to eat."
The Ingredient Recipe Maker solves this problem. The user can input their ingredients and our app will offer a recipe, as well as a related youtube video to help them decide what to cook.
